# Lecture 1 :- FlowChart + PseudoCode + Installation

Q1 What is the need of doing DSA Course?   
Ans. Whenever we apply for software engineer role in tech companies, the interviewers will ask some DSA Questions just to know how good problem solver you are. Interviewers will ask some DSA Questions that developers have to solve efficiently and optimistically by using DSA concepts.

Q2. List of Data Structures & Algorithms that we will be studying throughout this course?\
Ans. 

    Data Structures are of 2 types :-
    
    1. Primitive
    2. Non-Primitive 
   

    Non-Primitive Data Structures are of 2 types :-
   
    1. Linear - 
    2. Non-Linear - Tree, Graph, Table/Set


    Linear Data Structure are of 2 types :-

    1. Static - Arrays
    2. Dynamic - Vector (ArrayList), LinkedList, Queue, Stack


    Algorithms :- Dynamic Programming, Two Pointers Approach, Greedy Algorithms etc.

Q3. What is the first step that every student should follow before starting diving into the concepts of DSA?\
Ans. Student should learn any one programming language (C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript etc.).

    Student should practice the following basic concpets using any one programming language :- 

    1. Flowcharts & PseudoCode
    2. Variables, Data Types & Operators
    3. Conditional Statements
    4. Loops
    5. Functions

Q4. How to solve a problem?\
Ans. 

    Problem :- Find sum of 2 numbers : a & b    

    Solution :-

    1. Read the problem properly and try to understand the problem.
    2. Should have clarity of input (e.g. here inputs are a & b).
    3. Write the solution on paper using flowchart & pseudocode. (e.g. sum = a+b)
    4. Convert the solution written on paper to code. 

Q5. What is flowchart?\
Ans. Flowchart is the diagram of a solution.

    Draw flowchart of the problem (find sum of 2 numbers)
        - Start
        - Take input a & b
        - sum = a+b
        - print sum
        - Exit
  
Q6. What are different types of components of flowchart?\
Ans.

    1. Start/ Exit - Oval Shape
    2. Input/Output - Parallelogram Shape
    3. Process - Rectangle Shape
    4. Arrows - -> shape
    5. Decision (Condition is checked) - Diamond Shape

Q7. What is pseudocode?\
Ans. pseudocode is the general logic of solution.

Q8. Write the pseudocode for the above problem?\
Ans. We omit start in the beginning.

    1. Input a & b.
    2. sum = a+b;
    3. print sum;
    4. Exit

Q9. We have to write flowchart then pseudocode for each and every problem?\
Ans. No, we will write only pseudocode for a problem and will convert the pseudocode into code. Flowchart will not be used.

Q10. Practice questions for creating flowchart and writing pseudocode for a given problem.\
Ans. 

    1. Area of a square
    2. Minimum of 2 numbers
    3. Is a number even or odd
    4. Sum of numbers from 1 to N
    5. Is a number prime or not

Q11. Homework Questions :- \
Ans. 

    1. Calculate Simple Interest (SI) from Principal (P), Rate (R), Time (T). 
        
        - SI = P*R*T

    2. Calculate maximum of 2 numbers.
    3. Calculate factorial of a number
    4. Given a person's age, find if they shoould get a driving license or not

Q12. How does code run?\
Ans. A developer will write Java code inside digital notebook i.e. Visual Studio Code Editor or VS Code Editor. The translator i.e. Java compiler will take the Java code as an input and convert it into 0's & 1's language i.e. binary language or executable code which computer understands. Now, the computer will execute this executable code.

0 means current is not passed to the computer and 1 means current is passed to the computer.

Q13. What to download?\
Ans. 

    1. VS Code Editor
    2. Setup Java in your local machine (install Java compiler inside your local machine)
